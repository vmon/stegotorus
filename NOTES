To Test ObfsProxy:

start server (start-server.csh)
start client (start-client.csh)
start Tor (copy torrc.sample to etc/tor)


Now test tor: 
curl --socks4a 127.0.0.1:9060 -o - http://check.torproject.org


To add new steg modules:

1. Add a file below src/steg which implements a steg module; note that
the STEG_DEFINE_MODULE boilerplate macro is mandatory.  The name of
the file should be the same as the name of the module (as set by
STEG_DEFINE_MODULE) plus the .c extension.  
2. Add the file to the STEGANOGRAPHERS list in Makefile.am.  

That should be all that is necessary.
