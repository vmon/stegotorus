/**

 * in the range (0.0, 1.0] (note that this is _not_ the usual convention,
 * but it saves a call to nextafter() in the sole current user).
 *
 * For what we use this for, it is important that we can, at least
 * potentially, generate _every_ representable real number in the
 * desired interval, with genuine uniformity.  The usual tactic of
 * generating a random integer and dividing does not do this, because
 * the rational numbers produced by random()/MAX are evenly spaced on
 * the real line, but floating point numbers close to zero are *not*.
 *
 * For the same reason, the trick for avoiding division suggested
 * e.g. by "Common Lisp, the Language", generating a random number in
 * [1.0, 2.0) by overwriting the mantissa of a 1.0 and then
 * subtracting 1.0, does not help -- you can do the first step
 * precisely because the representable binary floating point numbers
 * between 1.0 and 2.0 *are* evenly spaced on the real line.
